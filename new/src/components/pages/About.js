              My name is Dominque Jenkins I am from small town called Jena, Louisiana I moved to Texas in 2015 to be closer
              to
              work, at the time i was working in west Texas on a drilling rig.
              I worked in the oil industry for the past twelve years and decided to make a career change. And I've always
              had
              a fascination with computer and how they work so i decided to
              check out the I.T. field so i did and liked it, so now Im here becoming a software developer.
